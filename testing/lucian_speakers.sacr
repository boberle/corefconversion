#title: Lucian, Dialogues of the Dead, 4: Hermes and Charon

#speaker: Hermes
Ferryman, what do you say to settling up accounts? It will prevent any
unpleasantness later on.

#speaker: Charon
Very good. It does save trouble to get these things straight.

#speaker: Hermes
One anchor, to your order, five shillings.

#speaker: Charon
That is a lot of money.

#speaker: Hermes
So help me Pluto, it is what I had to pay. One rowlock-strap, fourpence.

#speaker: Charon
Five and four; put that down.

#speaker: Hermes
Then there was a needle, for mending the sail; tenpence.

#speaker: Charon
Down with it.
