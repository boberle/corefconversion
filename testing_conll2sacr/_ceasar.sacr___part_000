{C0 Gaius Julius Caesar} ( {C1 12 or 13 July 100 BC} â€“ {C2 15 March 44 BC} ) , known by {C3 {C4 {C0 his} nomen} and {C5 cognomen} Julius Caesar} , was {C0 a Roman politician , military general , and historian {C0 who} played {C6 a critical role} in {C7 the events {C7 that} led to {C8 the demise of {C9 the Roman Republic}} and {C10 the rise of {C11 the Roman Empire}}}} . 

{C0 He} also wrote {C12 Latin prose} . 

In {C13 60 BC} , {C14 {C0 Caesar} , {C15 Crassus} and {C16 Pompey}} formed {C17 the First Triumvirate , a political alliance {C17 that} dominated {C18 Roman politics} for {C19 several years}} . 

{C14 Their} attempts to amass power as {C20 Populares} were opposed by {C21 the Optimates} within {C22 the Roman Senate} , among {C21 them} {C23 Cato the Younger} with {C24 the frequent support of {C25 Cicero}} . 

{C0 Caesar} rose to become one of {C26 the most powerful politicians in {C27 the Roman Republic}} through {C28 a number of {C29 {C0 his} accomplishments}} , notably {C30 {C0 his} victories in {C31 the Gallic Wars} , completed by {C32 51 BC}} . 

During this time , {C0 Caesar} became {C0 the first Roman general} to cross both {C33 {C34 the English Channel} and {C35 the Rhine River}} , when {C0 he} built {C36 a bridge across {C35 the Rhine}} and crossed {C34 the Channel} to invade {C37 Britain} . 

{C38 {C0 Caesar'} s wars} extended {C39 {C40 Rome'} s territory} to {C37 Britain} and past {C41 Gaul} . 

{C28 These achievements} granted {C0 him} unmatched {C42 military power} and threatened to eclipse {C43 the standing of {C16 Pompey , {C16 who} had realigned {C16 himself} with {C22 the Senate} after {C44 the death of {C15 Crassus}} in {C45 53 BC}}} . 

With {C31 the Gallic Wars} concluded , {C22 the Senate} ordered {C0 Caesar} to step down from {C46 {C0 his} military command} and return to {C40 Rome} . 

Leaving {C47 {C0 his} command} in {C41 Gaul} meant losing {C48 {C0 his} immunity from being charged as a criminal for waging {C49 unsanctioned wars}} . 

As a result , {C0 Caesar} found himself with no other options but to cross {C50 the Rubicon} with {C51 the 13th Legion} , leaving {C52 {C0 his} province} and illegally entering {C53 Roman Italy} under arms . 

{C54 This} began {C55 {C0 Caesar'} s civil war} , and {C56 {C0 his} victory in {C55 the war}} put {C0 him} in {C57 an unrivaled position of {C58 {C59 power} and {C60 influence}}} .
