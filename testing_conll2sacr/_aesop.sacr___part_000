{C0 A Peasant} found {C1 an Eagle captured in {C2 a trap}} , and much admiring {C1 the bird} , set {C0 him} free . 

{C1 The Eagle} did not prove ungrateful to {C0 {C1 his} deliverer} , for seeing {C0 the Peasant sitting under {C3 a wall {C3 which} was not safe}} , {C1 he} flew toward {C0 him} and with {C4 {C1 his} talons} snatched {C5 a bundle} from {C6 {C0 his} head} . 

When {C0 the Peasant} rose in pursuit , {C1 the Eagle} let {C5 the bundle} fall again . 

Taking {C5 it} up , {C0 the man} returned to {C7 the same place} , to find that {C3 the wall under {C3 which} {C0 he} had been sitting} had fallen to pieces ; and {C0 he} marveled at {C8 the service} rendered {C0 him} by {C1 the Eagle} .
